What is Hyperskill?

Hyperskill is a third-party platform that hosts JetBrains Academy's learning experience. While most of the learning will be available online on the Hyperskill portal at hyperskill.org, some parts of the service are accessible only via the JetBrains IDEs. The Java and Kotlin projects currently featured in Hyperskill are bundled with IntelliJ IDEA Edu, and the Python projects are bundled with PyCharm Edu.
